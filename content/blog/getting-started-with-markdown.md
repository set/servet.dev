# Getting Started with Markdown

Welcome to this comprehensive guide about using Markdown! This post will showcase various Markdown features and how they render on our blog.

## Typography Examples

### Basic Text Formatting

You can write text in **bold** or *italic*. You can also combine them for ***bold and italic*** text.

### Lists

Here's an unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a [link to Google](https://google.com)

And a numbered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It's great for highlighting important information or including quotes from other sources.
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.

### Code Blocks

Here's some inline code: `const greeting = "Hello, World!";`

And a code block with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Call the function
const result = calculateSum(5, 10);
console.log(result); // Output: 15
```

## Images

Here's an example of how to include images:

## Links and References
